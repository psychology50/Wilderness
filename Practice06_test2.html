    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use Javascript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
    </p><p>
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm language. It conforms to the ECMAScript specification,
    [14] and has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
    It has application programming interfaces for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model, or DOM.
